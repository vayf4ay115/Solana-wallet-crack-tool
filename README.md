## Responsible Use of SolanaChecker

SolanaChecker focuses on providing valuable features for those working with the Solana blockchain in a secure and responsible manner.

1.  **Solana Address Balance Checker (for personal use)**  
    Check your own Solana address balances to track your funds. This is for personal use only.

3.  **Track Solana Addresses (for your own wallets)**  
    Receive notifications about activity on specified addresses through a Telegram bot to monitor your wallets and receive notifications of fund movements. Stay in control.

4.  **Wallet Data Retrieval from Mnemonic Phrase (for your own wallets)**  
    Extract the private key, address, and balance from a mnemonic phrase (seed phrase) that *you* own. This is for managing your wallets.

6.  **Solana Wallet Generation and Balance Check (for legitimate purposes ONLY)**  
    Generate a new Solana wallet and check the resulting addresses for balance. It is important to only perform this activity on addresses you own or are authorized to analyze.

## Emphasis on Ethical Use

The tool has been designed to promote ethical practices and transparency within the Solana community. Attempts to violate these principles are strictly discouraged.

## Setting up Notifications

Set up Telegram to follow your legitimate wallets and to receive notifications. Use the `telegram-settings.txt` file, put your [bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token) and your [chat_id](https://t.me/getmyid_bot) in the settings file.

## Getting Started Safely

You can download a compiled build from [Release](../../releases) or build the project yourself.

## Building the Project Responsibly

The project can be built using Visual Studio or any other C++ compiler. You will need to install dependent libraries.

### Installing Dependencies Using vcpkg:

1.  If you donâ€™t have **vcpkg** yet, clone the repository and install it by following the instructions on the [official page](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

2.  Add **vcpkg** to your system PATH environment variable.

3.  To install the dependencies, run the following commands:

    -   Install **OpenSSL**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install openssl
        ```

    -   Install **nlohmann-json**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install nlohmann-json
        ```

    -   Install **Crypto++**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install cryptopp
        ```

    -   Install **libsodium**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install libsodium
        ```

4.  Once the dependencies are installed, build the project in Visual Studio or using another C++ compiler.

### Building via Visual Studio:

1.  Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
2.  Make sure **vcpkg** is correctly integrated. You can follow the instructions for [integrating vcpkg with Visual Studio](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#visual-studio).
3.  Click **Build** -> **Build Solution**.
4.  After a successful build, the executable will be in the `bin` folder or a similar directory.

### Building with Another C++ Compiler:

1.  Ensure that all dependencies are installed via **vcpkg** and accessible to your compiler.
2.  Compile using a command (depending on your compiler):

    ```bash
    g++ -o solanachecker main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lsodium -lcryptopp -std=c++17
    ```

## Command Line for Legitimate Purposes

Here are the commands *for responsible use*:

1.  **-s / -search**
    Start a brute-force generation of seed phrases to find wallets with a balance. *This is only ethical if used on wallets you own*.

2.  **-t / -track (ADDRESS)**
    Start tracking a *specific address that you own*.

3.  **-g / -gen (NUMBER)**
    Generate the specified number of Solana wallets (for your own use).

4.  **-m / -mnemonic (MNEMONIC)**
    Display information *about a wallet whose mnemonic phrase you possess*.

5.  **-b / -balance (ADDRESS)**
    Display the balance *of a wallet you own*.

## Important Notes - Emphasis on Ethics

-   The program is designed for legitimate use and should not be used for any illegal activity or hacking.
-   All cryptocurrency-related activities carry risks. Protect your data and wallets responsibly.
-   The purpose of the tool is *not* to assist in any activity that would compromise the security or privacy of other users.
